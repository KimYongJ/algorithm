### 문제 설명

<p><img alt="" src="https://upload.acmicpc.net/1b2ef7a0-9235-4a91-9d8b-a1ff39312e64/-/preview/" style="width: 209px; height: 165px; float: right;">The Ultimate Binary Watch is a maker project that uses small LEDs to display time on a watch face. The display uses four columns of four LEDs each, with each column representing one digit of the current time in hours and minutes. Time is displayed in 24-hour format, with the 1st (left-most) column displaying the tens position for hours, the 2nd column displaying the ones position for hours, the 3rd column displaying the tens position for minutes, and the last (right-most) column displaying the ones position for minutes. The bottom LED of each column shows the lowest-order bit of its represented digit, with the bit positions increasing moving up the column. For example, the time 1615 would be displayed as shown in the figure.</p>

<p>Write a program that will take a 24-hour time and print the corresponding watch face.</p>
